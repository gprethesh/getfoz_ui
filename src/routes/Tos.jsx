            1. <strong>No Nonsense:</strong> Here at getfoz.com, we're all about
            the fun stuff. We're not your lawyer, your mom, or the internet
            police. We're just here to facilitate opinion trading. So, behave
            yourself. Or don't. But don't say we didn't warn you if you end up
            in a heated debate over whether pineapple belongs on pizza.

            2. <strong>Play Nice:</strong> While we encourage spirited debates,
            let's keep it civil. Nobody likes a keyboard warrior. And we reserve
            the right to step in if things get too salty. Remember, opinions are
            like belly buttons - everybody's got one, and they're not always
            pretty.

            3. <strong>No Time Travel:</strong> Our platform operates in the
            here and now. That means your brilliant prediction about the 2020
            Presidential election won't hold much weight in 2023. Let's stick to
            the current space-time continuum, folks.

            4. <strong>Privacy Shmivacy:</strong> We'll do our best to protect
            your data. But this is the internet, folks. If you wouldn't shout it
            in a crowded room, maybe think twice before posting. Just a thought.

            5. <strong>Sorcerer's Apprentice Rule:</strong> You are responsible
            for your actions on our platform. If you accidentally trade your
            favorite opinion on whether cats are superior to dogs for an opinion
            that dogs are, in fact, the best - well, that's on you. We're not
            magicians, and we can't untrade your trades.
          </p>

            6. <strong>Keep Your Receipts:</strong> Opinions traded are final.
            If you swap your belief that ketchup is a proper pasta sauce (ew)
            for the belief that socks and sandals are a fashion crime (true),
            there's no returns department. You made your bed, now lie in it.

            Remember, these TOS are designed to keep things light-hearted and
            respectful. Now, go forth and trade your heart out!
