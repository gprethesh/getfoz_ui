            1. <strong>Your Data, Your Rules:</strong> We're not interested in
            collecting your data just for kicks. Any information we collect
            (like the fact that you think alien invasions are a valid reason to
            skip work) is used to make your Getfoz experience better, not to
            plot world domination.
          </p>
          <p className="max-w-sm sm:max-w-md md:max-w-lg lg:max-w-xl mt-5">
            2. <strong>No Peeping Toms:</strong> We don't share your information
            with third parties without your express consent. And by 'express
            consent', we mean you'd have to send us a video of you doing the
            Macarena and stating clearly, "Yes, Getfoz, you may share my data."

            3. <strong>Cookies Aren't Just For Eating:</strong> We use cookies
            on our site. But these aren't the delicious, chocolate-chip variety.
            They're the digital kind that help us understand how you use our
            platform. They're pretty bland tasting, trust us.
          </p>
          <p className="max-w-sm sm:max-w-md md:max-w-lg lg:max-w-xl mt-5">
            4. <strong>Control is in Your Hands:</strong> You can review,
            modify, or delete your personal data at any time. But please note,
            if you delete your belief that baby Yoda is adorable, we may judge
            you. Just a little.
          </p>
          <p className="max-w-sm sm:max-w-md md:max-w-lg lg:max-w-xl mt-5">
            5. <strong>Keeping Things Secure:</strong> We use industry-standard
            security measures to protect your information. Think of it as a
            digital guard dog - minus the barking and potential for slobber.

            6. <strong>Change is Inevitable:</strong> We might update this
            policy from time to time, but we'll let you know. Probably not via
            skywriting, but we'll make sure you get the message.
          </p>
