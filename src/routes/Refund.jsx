            1. <strong>Winner Takes All, Sort Of:</strong> If your opinion is a
            winner (i.e., you've successfully predicted the outcome), you take
            home double the amount you bet. But remember, the taxman cometh! We
            deduct a 20% tax, because, unfortunately, we can't make the taxman
            vanish.
          </p>
          <p className="max-w-sm sm:max-w-md md:max-w-lg lg:max-w-xl mt-5">
            2. <strong>Unmatched Brilliance:</strong> If you place a bid that
            nobody matches, we consider you as unmatched in your brilliance (or
            maybe your folly). Either way, you'll get a 100% refund, no matter
            the event's outcome.
          </p>
          <p className="max-w-sm sm:max-w-md md:max-w-lg lg:max-w-xl mt-5">
            3. <strong>opinion on a Losing Horse:</strong> If you place a
            opinion on the losing outcome, your amount is lost. Remember, not
            everyone can be a winner, but there's always next time.
          </p>
          <p className="max-w-sm sm:max-w-md md:max-w-lg lg:max-w-xl mt-5">
            4. <strong>Resolving the Unresolved:</strong> Only after an event is
            resolved, and all bets are processed, will the refunds be issued.
            It's a bit like waiting for a pot of coffee to brew - worth the
            wait!
          </p>
          <p className="max-w-sm sm:max-w-md md:max-w-lg lg:max-w-xl mt-5">
            5. <strong>Secure Vaults:</strong> All refunds are securely
            deposited back into your account balance. Just don't expect a fancy
            bank vault. It's a digital vault, not quite as impressive, but
            equally secure.
          </p>
          <p className="max-w-sm sm:max-w-md md:max-w-lg lg:max-w-xl mt-5">
            6. <strong>Change Happens:</strong> We might change this policy from
            time to time, but we promise to keep you posted. No, we won't send
            carrier pigeons, but we'll make sure you're not left in the dark.
          </p>
